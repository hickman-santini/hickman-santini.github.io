  <p><b>Research.</b> My research interests include prediction markets, automated discovery, and energy policy. I bring causal inference methods to bear on problems facing the national security and international development communities. Lately, I've been working with <i>n</i>Line Inc. on inferring electrical grid topology from customer-level sensor readings. I am advised by <a href="https://www.ratiocination.org/">Benjamin Jantzen</a> and <a href="https://www.shaddih.com/">Shaddi Hasan</a>.</p>

    <td><b>About Me.</b> I grew up in Silver Spring and Royal Oak, Maryland. I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics, with a minor in Modern Languages and Linguistics, from University of Maryland - Baltimore County (UMBC). I play a lot of music, mainly Appalachian traditional string-band music, and most recently picked up the fiddle. In non-COVID times, I loved to go to the many old-time jams in and around Blacksburg. If I weren't a computer scientist, I would be writing and performing musical accompaniment for puppet shows.</td>
