  <p><b>Research.</b> My research interests include prediction markets, automated discovery, and energy policy. I bring causal inference methods to bear on problems facing the national security and international development communities. Lately, I've been working with <i>n</i>Line Inc. on inferring electrical grid topology from customer-level sensor readings.</p>

    <td><b>About Me.</b> I grew up in Silver Spring and Royal Oak, Maryland. I received my undergraduate degree in Mathematics, with a minor in Modern Languages and Linguistics, from University of Maryland - Baltimore County (UMBC). I play a lot of music, mainly Appalachian traditional string-band music, and most recently picked up the fiddle. In non-COVID times, I loved to go to the many old-time jams in and around Blacksburg. If I weren't a computer scientist, I would be writing and performing musical accompaniment for puppet shows.</td>

  <p><b>Family.</b> My mom Busy Graham is an incredible arts organizer and advocate. She currently runs the non-profit Carpe Diem Arts, bringing visual, performing, and literary arts into schools, retirement homes, and detention centers. My dad Stewart Hickman worked in organizational training and development, working with such organizations as USAID and the KIPP charter school system. He is recently and well-deservedly retired, and spends his time wood-working and writing amazing poetry and prose. I have siblings and nieces and a nephew, whom I love. I'm married to an excellent visual artist and DevOps engineer, Giulio Santini.</p>

    <li>Python, TA'd CS 2064 Spring 2020, helped develop course material;</li>
    <li>Privately tutored elementary math, AP Calculus, Algebra II, and discrete structures, sometimes for hearing- or vision-impaired students;</li>
    <li>Tutored statistics and pre-algebra at correctional facilities through Goucher Prison Education Partnership for two semesters;</li>
    <li>TA'd Intro to Programming (Python course) at UMBC, developed lesson plans for weekly labs.</li>
    <li>I still occasionally take private tutoring clients. If you are a motivated student of calculus or discrete structures and are interested in working with, let's be in touch! &#128578 Email me at mollygh (at) vt (dot) edu.
